==========
It has been years or months since I did something on github.

GraphQL sucks. It's just API with extra steps. 
Working with HTTP REST is easier and you can talk HTTP through myriad of APIs on many platforms. By default.
I've read some articles and comments on the net and I can't see any benefits. I see only several useless steps.
Articles are just the content. I found few comments and a small discussion related to live applications and
how GraphQL helps. they were probably devs who started from graphql. from description it looked like
the frontend clients had no idea how to make frontend clients. Backend and frontend were not working together.
Probably nobody in those companies never heard about performance and doesn't care for the quality provided to users.
it's a madhouse.

Will remove this junk and do some fun REST APIs here instead.
